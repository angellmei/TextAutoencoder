# TextAutoencoder
This project is a text auto-encoder that takes in a sequence of words and in return, gives an embedding that is supposed to represent the entire input. This is done using a Recurrent Neural Network and the Cross Entropy loss function. The p4model.pk file represents the pre-trained weights and the training data used needed over 50 epochs and was also quite large.
